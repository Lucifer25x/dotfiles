# My polybar config files
*Currently I use customized forest theme from [Polybar Themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes)* repository.*

### For my own config file, you may need to install `rofi-power-menu`, `pavucontrol` and `polybar-protonvpn`
[Rofi Power Menu](https://github.com/jluttine/rofi-power-menu)
[Pavucontrol](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pavucontrol/)
[Polybar ProtonVPN](https://github.com/haideralipunjabi/polybar-protonvpn)
